## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

`PROJECT DESCRIPTION:` We were tasked with creating a new portfolio application using React. We were asked to include our name, links to our GitHub & LinkedIn profiles (as well as our email and phone number), and a list of projects that included the project title and links to the Deployed site & repositories.

We were tasked with including at least 3 components: a Header, a Project component (in my case, I called my component 'portfolio'), and a Footer. We were also challenged to try and use react component libraries to use animations.
